## Introduction

### Aims

This projects aim is to do data analysis on Fishers Iris data set (UCI Machine Learning Repository, 2007) utilising Python code to do the analysis. This project will show the research and investigation done on the data set through the description of the analysis techniques and the results gathered from the running python analysis programs on the data.

The project will be broken down into several basic tasks 

- Research of the Iris data set and summarisation to the README file
- Download and addition of the data set to the Project repository
-  Write analysis.py program to include
    - Output a summary of each variable to a single text file
    - Save a histogram of each variable to a png file
    - Output a scatter plot of each variable
    - Additional Analysis


### Background
The Iris dataset was first introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" (Kaggle, 2023). The dataset consists of three species of Iris.
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Virginica
- Iris Versicolor

There are fifty samples of each species measured totalling 150 rows of data in the set. Each row od data consistes of four measurements taken of the lenght and width of the sepals and petals measured in centimeters.
